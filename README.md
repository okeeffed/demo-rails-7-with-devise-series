# Demo: Rails 7 With Devise Series

This repo is a partner to the blog series ["Devise with Ruby on Rails 7"]().

The series will cover the following:

1. Setting up a basic sign up and login flow with Devise.
2. Using Redis sessions instead of cookies.
3. Adding Tailwind to our project to beautify the sign-up flow.
4. Authorizing separate frontends to use our Rails API.
5. Setting up Devise with Omniauth to our project to sign in with GitHub OAuth.
6. Adding in Recaptcha to our project to protect against spam.

## Getting started

Depending on which blog post you are up to, the starting point will be set as the following branches:

1. `0-start`
2. `1-setting-up-devise`
3. `2-using-redis-sessions`
4. `3-adding-tailwind`
5. `4-seperate-frontends`
6. `5-github-oauth`
7. `6-recaptcha`
8. `7-testing-authentication`
9. `8-authorization`
10. `9-devise-failure-app`

Each branch will have the final code for that section. `main` will also have the completed code.
